> ⚠️ `!add` **must** be used inside a **paper session channel**. It supports **multiple mentions** and starts the exam timer for added users.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

> Ensure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (optional If running with Docker) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) are installed before setup.

---

### 1️⃣ Setup Environment Variables (Required)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory. You can use the example provided in `examples/.env`:

```bash
cp examples/.env .env
```

Edit the file to include your credentials:

```env
TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
CLIENT_ID=your_application_client_id
CATEGORY_ID=your_paper_sessions_category_id
GUILD_ID=your_guild_id
```

Set `MONGO_URL` depending on your setup:

- **If running the bot fully with Docker (Option 1):**

```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb://mongo:27017/botData
```

- **If running the bot manually (locally) while MongoDB runs in Docker (Option 2):**

```env
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/botData
```

> ⚠️ Do not commit `.env` to GitHub. Keep it private.

> 💡 **Important:** When you add new environment variables to `.env`, remember to also add the variable name to the `requiredVars` array in the `validateEnvironmentVariables()` function in `index.js`. This ensures the bot validates that all required environment variables are set when it starts.

---

## 🐳 Option 1: Run Bot with Docker

> 💡 Tip: Make sure your terminal/command prompt is opened in the project folder (`paperpulsebot`) when running any Docker commands below, e.g., `docker compose up -d`.

1. **Start Bot and MongoDB together:**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Runs both the bot and MongoDB containers in detached mode.

- `.env` file is used automatically for environment variables.

2. **Rebuild containers after code changes:**

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Rebuilds the Docker images to include any changes in code or dependencies.

- Ensures the latest code is running inside the container.

> 💡 Tip: For development, after making code changes you can run this command and apply your latest code without touching the manual setup.

3. **Check running containers:**

```bash
docker ps
```

4. **Stop containers (if needed):**

```bash
docker compose down
```

> 💡 Tip: Always use `docker compose down -v` if you want to remove MongoDB data and start fresh.

---

## ⚙️ Option 2: Manual Setup

### 1. Setup MongoDB

1. **Pull the MongoDB image:**

```bash
docker pull mongo
```

2. **Run MongoDB container:**

```bash
docker run -d --name paperpulse-mongo -p 27017:27017 -v mongo-data:/data/db mongo
```

- `-d` runs the container in detached mode.

- `--name` gives the container a name.

- `-p` maps local port 27017 to container port 27017.

- `-v` creates a volume for data persistence.

3. **Check if MongoDB container is running:**

```bash
docker ps
```

4. **Stop MongoDB container (if needed):**

```bash
docker stop paperpulse-mongo
```

5. **Start MongoDB container again:**

```bash
docker start paperpulse-mongo
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jienniers/paperpulsebot.git
cd paperpulsebot
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Clear old Slash Commands (Optional)

```bash
node scripts/clear-slash-commands.js
```

### 5. Register Slash Commands (optional if already registered)

```bash
node scripts/deploy-slash-commands.js
```

### 6. Start the Bot

```bash
node index.js
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### State Management

PaperPulseBot uses a **two-tier state system** combining in-memory state with MongoDB persistence:

#### In-Memory State (`data/state.js`)

The bot maintains several in-memory maps to track active sessions:

- **`examinersMap`**: Maps `channelId → examinerId` (tracks which examiner is running which session)
- **`paperChannels`**: Array of active paper session channel IDs
- **`paperTimeMinsMap`**: Maps `channelId → duration` (exam duration in minutes)
- **`paperRunningMap`**: Maps `channelId → boolean` (whether the timer is currently running)
- **`candidateSessionsMap`**: Maps composite keys to candidate session data

#### Composite Key Format

Candidate sessions use a **composite key pattern**: `userId::channelId`

- Example: `"123456789::987654321"` (user 123456789 in channel 987654321)
- This allows tracking multiple sessions for the same user across different channels
- Keys are split with `COMPOSITE_KEY_SEPARATOR` constant (`::`)

### State Synchronization

The bot syncs state between memory and MongoDB every **5 seconds** with **debouncing**:

1. **Initialization** (`initializeAndSyncState`):
    - Load all persistent state from MongoDB into memory
    - Clean up orphaned entries from deleted Discord channels
    - Start periodic sync interval

2. **Periodic Sync** (every 5 seconds):
    - Only syncs if at least 1 second has passed since last sync (debounce)
    - Sends all in-memory state to MongoDB
    - Prevents database hammering

3. **Graceful Shutdown**:
    - On `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM`, performs final sync before exiting
    - Ensures no state is lost on unexpected shutdowns

### Data Flow
